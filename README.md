# Lossless Cookbook

A comprehensive guide to Lossless concepts, methodologies, and practices written for a general audience.

## Overview

The Lossless Cookbook is an ebook that serves as an accessible introduction to:
- Core concepts and methodologies
- Best practices and patterns
- Real-world examples and case studies
- Practical applications and solutions

## About This Project

This cookbook is distinct from our developer documentation (found in the `docs` directory). While our documentation focuses on technical details for developers, this cookbook is written for a broader audience interested in understanding and applying Lossless principles.

## Built with mdBook

This ebook is generated using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), an open-source tool created by the Rust team. The mdBook source code is included in our monorepo as a git submodule (in the `mdbook` directory) but we are not the authors - all credit for mdBook goes to the Rust team and its contributors.

## Structure

- `src/` - Source markdown files for the cookbook
- `book.toml` - Configuration for mdBook
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns

## Development

This repository uses mdBook for ebook generation. The development workflow follows a branching strategy with:
- `master` branch for stable releases
- `development` branch for ongoing work
